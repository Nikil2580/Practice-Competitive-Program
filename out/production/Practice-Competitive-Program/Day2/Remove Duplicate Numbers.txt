Today's Program to solve

Given a string s, remove duplicate letters so that every 
letter appears once and only once. 
You must make sure your result is the smallest in 
lexicographical order among all possible results.

Example 1:
Input: s = "b c a b c"
	    1 2 0 1 2

Output: "abc"


Example 2:


Input: s = "c b a c d c b c"
	    2 1 0 2 3 2 1 2

Output: "acdb"
