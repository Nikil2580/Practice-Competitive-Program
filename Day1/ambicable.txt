Proper divisor:
A proper divisor of a positive integer is any divisor other than itself.
Let the sum of proper divisors of 'n' be defined as f(n) = a,
and the sum of proper divisors of 'a' be defined as f(a) = m.

When 'n' and 'm' are equal, 'n' is called an 'amicable number. You are required to implement the following function:
int amicableNumbers(n)

This function returns: 1, if 'n' is an 'amicable number 0, otherwise No

Assumptions

There are no proper divisors of 1.

Example Input(n):
220

Output: 1

Explanation:
The proper divisors of 220 (n) are 1,2,4,5,10,11,20,22,44,55 and 110. This f(220) = 284
The proper divisors of 284 (a) are 1,2,4,71 and 142. Since f(284) = 220, hence 1 is returned.
